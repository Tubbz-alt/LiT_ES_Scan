LiT_ES_Scan
===========

This repository contains a version of LiTrack optimized for FACET along 
with ES and Scan tools. This is a substantial revision from the original 
LiTrack and does not contain all of the functionality of the original.

First, add LiT_ES_Scan and subfolders to your MATLAB search path. Do not 
worry about conflicting function names if you have another version of 
LiTrack installed. All of the functions in LiT_ES_Scan have new names.

Try running:
Examples/example_lit.m

Beamline files are in

LiTrack/Beamlines

Parameter files are in

LiTrack/Parameters

Suggestion: create a directory called 'scratch' in LiT_ES_Scan and work on 
files there. Feel free to add your files to the repository if you think 
they will be useful to others. If you are not sure which folder to put your 
file in, contact Spencer at sgess@slac.stanford.edu.
